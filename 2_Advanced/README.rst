Advanced NGSolve Examples
===========================

In section 2 of the `mylittlengsolve tutorial code <https://github.com/NGSolve/mylittlengsolve>`_
we present some more advanced examples which may
useful for more experienced NGSolve programmers, there is not much documentation yet (and I don't
know when there will be some) but if you have questions feel free to use our
`forum <https://ngsolve.org/forum/index>`_ to ask.
