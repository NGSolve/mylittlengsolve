NGSolve Basics
=================


Firstly we want to show how you can modify NGSolve classes to your needs and export them to
Python for proper use. This is not intended as an introduction to C++ programming, but to guide you
to the C++ parts of NGSolve. Some basic concepts of object orientated programming, generic programming
(templates and that stuff) will make life a lot easier here ;) It is as well recommended to have
a basic knowledge about C++11 features like smart pointers and lambda functions.

Later parts of this tutorial may depend on earlier parts so it's recommended to read it in order,
however with some C++ experience it should be ok to start anywhere.
