MyLittleNGSolve - An Introduction into C++ Programming with NGSolve
======================================================================

This project is divided into 3 sections:

The `basic section`_ should provide you with knowledge about NGSolve's classes and
how to overload them or provide C++ utility functions, as well as export all that to python.

The `advanced section`_ gives some more useful examples to browse through.

The legacy section contains old code, it may be useful mainly for people working already for some
time with NGSolve and looking something up. Please keep in mind, that these things are not
maintained and may contain code that does not work (efficiently) any more.

.. _basic section: 1_Basic/README.rst
.. _advanced section: 2_Advanced/README.rst
